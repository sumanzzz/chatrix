# Chatrix Moderation Guidelines

This document outlines moderation policies, legal considerations, and recommended practices for running Chatrix in production.

## üõ°Ô∏è Moderation Philosophy

Chatrix is designed as an anonymous chat platform with minimal moderation to preserve user privacy and freedom of expression. However, some basic safety measures are implemented to prevent abuse.

## üîß Built-in Safety Features

### Technical Safeguards
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 messages per minute per user
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation prevents malicious input
- **XSS Protection**: HTML escaping prevents script injection
- **Room-level Bans**: Room owners can ban users permanently
- **Temporary Kicks**: 1-minute cooldown for kicked users

### User Controls
- **Room Ownership**: Room creators have full control over their rooms
- **Anonymous Naming**: No personal information is collected or stored
- **Voluntary Participation**: Users can leave rooms at any time
- **No Persistent Data**: Messages and user data are not permanently stored

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Considerations

### Privacy & Data Protection
- **No Personal Data**: Chatrix does not collect or store personal information
- **Anonymous by Design**: Users are assigned random anonymous names
- **No IP Logging**: Server does not log or store IP addresses
- **Temporary Storage**: All data is stored in memory and lost on server restart

### Content Liability
- **User-Generated Content**: All messages are created by users
- **No Content Monitoring**: Messages are not actively monitored or filtered
- **Room Owner Responsibility**: Room creators are responsible for their rooms
- **User Responsibility**: Users are responsible for their own messages

### Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR**: No personal data collection means minimal GDPR obligations
- **COPPA**: Anonymous design reduces COPPA concerns
- **DMCA**: No content storage means minimal DMCA obligations
- **Local Laws**: Comply with local laws regarding chat platforms

## üö® Abuse Prevention

### Recommended Server-Side Measures

1. **Enhanced Rate Limiting**
   ```javascript
   // Implement stricter rate limiting for production
   const RATE_LIMIT = 50; // Reduce from 100
   const RATE_WINDOW = 60000; // 1 minute
   ```

2. **IP-based Blocking**
   ```javascript
   // Add IP blocking for repeat offenders
   const blockedIPs = new Set();
   // Block IP after multiple violations
   ```

3. **Content Filtering** (Optional)
   ```javascript
   // Basic profanity filter
   const PROFANITY_FILTER = ['word1', 'word2'];
   // Filter messages before broadcasting
   ```

4. **Room Size Limits**
   ```javascript
   // Limit room size to prevent spam
   const MAX_ROOM_SIZE = 50;
   // Reject joins when room is full
   ```

### Monitoring & Logging

1. **Error Logging**
   - Log connection errors and rate limit violations
   - Monitor server performance and memory usage
   - Track room creation and user activity patterns

2. **Abuse Detection**
   - Monitor for rapid room creation (potential spam)
   - Track users creating multiple accounts
   - Watch for coordinated abuse patterns

3. **Alert System**
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity
   - Monitor server resources and performance
   - Track error rates and connection issues
